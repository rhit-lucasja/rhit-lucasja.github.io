        <p>Hello all, and welcome to my personal website!</p>
        <pre>
            I know this website is not much, and it is still a work in progress, as I am coding it 100% from scratch!

            I am currently a first-year student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. At Rose, I am studying Computer Science, Data Science, and Cybersecurity.

            Along with this website, I've included a portfolio of some of my favorite projects (academic and personal). See below!
