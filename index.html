                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a first-year student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
                    While at Rose, I study Computer Science, and I hope to extend my studies into
                    the following areas of interest to me:

                        <b>Mathematics - </b>Mathematics has been my favorite core subject for years, and I love solving
                                         challenging math problems. I currently plan to double major in Mathematics, likely
                                         concentrating on discrete math and its applications to computer science.

                        <b>Cybersecurity - </b>Security and defense have always been areas of interest to me.
                                           As part of the Rose Computer Security Club, I enjoy completing CTFs,
                                           especially those in the reverse engineering category. I have taken
                                           Practical Security courses and plan to minor in Cybersecurity.

                                          and I am interested by this field that combines mathematics with
                                          computer science. I may pursue a minor in Data Science.

                    I also find it entertaining, as a personal project, to code this website 100% from scratch!
                    Thus, it is a continuous work in progress which I will update as I gain experience.

                <h2>Object-Oriented Game Design Project</h2>
                <p>This project was completed as part of my Object-Oriented Software Development class.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Task:</b> Create an arcade-style game based on the 1983 game <i>Jetpac</i>
                    while implementing proper object-oriented design principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism,
                    dispatch, and abstraction. Also required were various aspects to the game, such as collectible items
                    and different types of enemies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Result:</b> <i>Rose Bonfir</i>, and Rose-Hulman-themed spinoff developed by
                    myself, Nakul Mital, and Xingzhao An. The game puts you in control of Rosie, the beloved mascot,
                    who must use her jetpack to pick up pallets and fuel for building the annual Rose-Hulman bonfire.
                    Along the way, she must avoid and disable various enemy drones by hacking them with binary code.

                <h3>Favorite Feature: Custom Level Editor</h3>
                <p>
                    My favorite additional feature for <i>Rose Bonfir</i> is the level editor, which allows users
                    to place Rosie, the bonfire, and multiple platforms in a custom level layout. The layout is
                    then saved to a file, where it can be loaded and played from the level selection menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hardest part of the level creator was preventing certain illegal level formats. However, I
                    was able to implement certain conditions that were checked before placing elements and/or saving
                    a level to a file. Now, the level creator prevents issues like a bonfire floating in midair,
                    or a level with no spawn point for Rosie!

            <h2>Neural Networks and Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Over the summer, I studied and learned the basics of machine learning. Although I initially learned
                the basics of neural networks while operating on the MNIST dataset, I decided for this purpose to
                create a new network from scratch to showcase my ability to adapt models for different problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                This network is built purely using Python and numpy. It operates on an XOR dataset that I randomly generated.
                For each random input (x,y), the output is 0 when x and y have the same signs and 1 when x and y have
                different signs. Hence, the problem is XOR-like, since it is not linearly separable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using pyplot, I generated various graphs to showcase the typical performance of my network below. In this 
                particular run, I employed a no-improvement-in-twenty epochs method to cause early stoppage. This learning
                cycle went for about 25 epochs, achieving an ultimate accuracy of 92%. I tried to optimize the structure
                and hyperparameters of the network as much as possible, but given the short period it was built in, I am
                pretty satisfied with the overall result. I also integrated certain optimization techniques, such as a
                variable learning rate and L2 regularization, into this newly created network.
