                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a first-year student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
                    While at Rose, I study Computer Science, and I intend to extend my studies into
                    the following areas of interest to me:

                        <b>Data Science - </b>I researched neural networks and machine learning over the summer,
                                          and I am very interested by the field that heavily combines mathematics
                                          with computer science and AI/ML. I hope to double major in Data Science.

                        <b>Cybersecurity - </b>Security and defense have always been areas of interest to me, particularly
                                           as more and more data is made vulnerable online. As part of the Rose Computer
                                           Security Club, I enjoy completing challenging CTFs, particularly reverse engineering.
                                           I have taken some Practical Security courses and plan to minor in Cybersecurity.

                    I find it much more entertaining, as a personal project, to code this website 100% from scratch!
                    As a result, this website is still a work in progress.

                    Along with this website, below are some of my favorite projects (academic and personal)!

                <h2>Object-Oriented Game Design Project</h2>
                <p>This project was completed as part of my Object-Oriented Software Development class.</p>
                <p>The result was <i>Rose Bonfir</i>, an arcade game based on the '80s game <i>Jetpac</i>, developed by myself, Nakul Mital, and Xingzhao An.</p>
