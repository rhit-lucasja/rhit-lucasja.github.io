                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a first-year student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
                    While at Rose, I study Computer Science, and I intend to extend my studies into
                    the following areas of interest to me:

                    <li style="padding-bottom: 8px">
                        <b>Data Science - </b>I researched neural networks and machine learning over the summer,
                                          and I am very interested by the field that heavily combines mathematics
                                          with computer science and AI/ML. I hope to double major in Data Science.

                        <b>Cybersecurity - </b>Security and defense have always been areas of interest to me, particularly
                                           as more and more data is made vulnerable online. As part of the Rose Computer
                                           Security Club, I enjoy completing challenging CTFs, particularly those pertaining
                                           to reverse engineering. I have taken some Practical Security courses and plan to
                                           minor in Cybersecurity.

                    I also find it entertaining, as a personal project, to code this website 100% from scratch!
                    Thus, it is a continuous work in progress which I will update as I gain experience.

                <h2>Object-Oriented Game Design Project</h2>
                <p>This project was completed as part of my Object-Oriented Software Development class.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Task:</b> Create an arcade-style game based on the 1983 game <i>Jetpac</i>
                    while implementing proper object-oriented design principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism,
                    dispatch, and abstraction. Also required were various aspects to the game, such as collectible items
                    and different types of enemies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Result:</b> <i>Rose Bonfir</i>, and Rose-Hulman-themed spinoff developed by
                    myself, Nakul Mital, and Xingzhao An. The game puts you in control of Rosie, the beloved mascot,
                    who must use her jetpack to pick up pallets and fuel for building the annual Rose-Hulman bonfire.
                    Along the way, she must avoid and disable various enemy drones by hacking them with binary code.

                <h3>Favorite Feature: Custom Level Editor</h3>
                <p>
                    My favorite additional feature for <i>Rose Bonfir</i> is the level editor, which allows users
                    to place Rosie, the bonfire, and multiple platforms in a custom level layout. The layout is
                    then saved to a file, where it can be loaded and played from the level selection menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hardest part of the level creator was preventing certain illegal level formats. However, I
                    was able to implement certain conditions that were checked before placing elements and/or saving
                    a level to a file. Now, the level creator prevents issues like a bonfire floating in midair,
                    or a level with no spawn point for Rosie!

                <h2>Neural Networks and Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the summer, I studied and learned the basics of machine learning. Following is information about
                    some of the various neural networks I created, these ones in particular tailored to the MNIST number
                    recognition dataset, although they have different hyperparameters and different implementations.
